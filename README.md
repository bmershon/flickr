# Flickr

An essay written while attending Writers in New York 2014 at NYU.

This essay describes my fascination with Flickr and experience engaging with street photography for the first time while I was a student at NYU's summer writing program.

The album I created (and printed for myself) which prompted me to write this essay can be found [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/brooksmershon/albums/72157644518138170).
